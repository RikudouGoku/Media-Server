- [Part 1: Synology DS423+](docs/NAS-01.md)
- [Part 2: Orange Pi 5 Plus](docs/NAS-02.md)

Part 1 is an impression post of the Synology DS423+ after some time of using it. 

Part 2 is a step by step guide on how to set up your own cheap NAS/Server using an Orange Pi 5 Plus with OpenMediaVault (should work with other SBCs as well though).
